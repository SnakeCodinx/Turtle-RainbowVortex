# Rainbow Vortex

appears to swirl and twirl like a vortex. The pattern is formed by drawing a series of connected circles with increasing radii, with each circle being drawn in a different color from the HSV color space. The colorsys module is used to convert HSV values to RGB colors, creating a smooth transition between colors.
